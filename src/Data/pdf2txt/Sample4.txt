Worts Just Say No!
The Boston Wort Processors once
again voted against the grain and
elected local representatives to
positions of power over the major
parties’ candidates. Despite
repeated accusations of public
drinking from the opposition, the
Worts elected to office:

• President — Greg
Kushmerek

• Vice President — Jeff
Flood

• Secretary — Ken Jucks
• Libeerian — Shekar

Nimkar
• Treasurer — Mike Fertsch

Top Democratic and Republican
spokesmen were not available for
comment at press time.

President
Usually, politicians say “Thanks for
giving me the chance to do this for
all of us.” I think I should say:
“Maybe I shouldn’t have volunteered
to do all of that stuff—you went and
made me president!”

All joking aside, I want to say that I
look forward to the upcoming year
with all of you. We have one of the
best brew clubs around with a large,
active base, a number of committed
individuals (with those who should
be committed), and a lot of fun
activities.

Fun, though, takes some work. We do
a lot in a year, and I’m already
hearing about some of the events that
people are getting excited about such
as:

Parties
• Lounge Lizard Slither
• Anniversary Party
• Mayfest
• Club Picnic
• Pub Crawl
• Cider Picnic

Competitions
• BHC ‘97
• AHA Club-only
